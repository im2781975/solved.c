Explanation:
Here, the first character was s and it has been shifted by 5 units, that is, s+5 = x, thus we got the character ‘x’ in the output. Similarly all the character by shifting the characters by 5 units. Take a closer look at the last character. The character was ‘y’ but after shifting it by 5 units we got ‘d’. That is because we traversed the letters in a circular fashion. After ‘y’ comes ‘z’ then ‘a’ then ‘b’ then ‘c’ and then finally ‘d’. Thus, ‘y’+5 will be ‘d’ in our program. */
