Explanation:
Here, the first character was s and it has been shifted by 5 units, that is, s+5 = x, thus we got the character ‘x’ in the output*/
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    char s[100];
    scanf("%s",s);
    int k;
    scanf("%d",&k);
    for(int i=0; i<strlen(s); i++)
    {
        int asciiValue=s[i];
        if((asciiValue+k)<=122)
            printf("%c",(asciiValue+k));
        else
        {
            int rem=(((asciiValue+k)-122)%26);
            if(rem==0)
                printf("z");
            else
                printf("%c",rem+96);
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
