/* You are given a matrix of size NxN where N is the row and column number. Now first line of the input will contain the 
value of N , and the next line will contain the matrix.
Now print the matrix in the following way –
>> 1st row and 1st column and skip the common value of them
>> 2nd row and 2nd column and skip the common value of them
>> nth row and nth column and skip the common value of them
See the sample output for more clarification
Sample Input: Sample Output:
3
 row-1 and column-1 = 2 3 4 7
row-2 and column-2 = 4 6 2 8
1 2 3 row-3 and column-3 = 7 8 3 6 
4 5 6 
7 8 9 */
